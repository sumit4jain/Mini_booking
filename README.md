While building the full-stack movie booking application, one major challenge was designing a reliable seat-booking system that prevents double booking. This was solved by validating seat availability at the backend and locking selected seats before confirmation. Another challenge was managing authentication and role-based access, which was handled using JWT tokens and protected routes for users and admins. Ensuring responsive UI across devices required careful use of Tailwind’s grid and breakpoint utilities. Integrating smooth UI flows without affecting performance was addressed using lightweight animations and optimized state management. Finally, structuring the backend in a scalable and deployment-ready manner was achieved by following a clean MVC architecture with environment-based configurations.
